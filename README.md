## Introduction
Pose estimation is a computer vision technique that detects human joints and maps them to a human skeleton model. This project leverages pose estimation to recognize and classify human actions. It is useful in various applications, such as sports analytics, human-computer interaction, and video surveillance.

## Features
- Detect human poses from images or videos.
- Classify actions based on detected poses.
- Pre-trained models for pose estimation.
- Easy to extend for custom action recognition tasks.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/action-recognition-pose-estimation.git
    cd action-recognition-pose-estimation
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use the action recognition system, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your input data:**
    - Ensure your images or videos are in the correct format and placed in the appropriate directories.

2. **Run pose estimation:**
    ```bash
    python pose_estimation.py --input path_to_your_input --output path_to_output
    ```

3. **Run action recognition:**
    ```bash
    python action_recognition.py --input path_to_pose_data --output path_to_action_results
    ```

## Examples
Here are some example commands and their expected outputs:

1. **Pose Estimation Example:**
    ```bash
    python pose_estimation.py --input sample_video.mp4 --output poses.json
    ```
    This will generate a JSON file containing the detected poses for each frame in the video.

2. **Action Recognition Example:**
    ```bash
    python action_recognition.py --input poses.json --output actions.json
    ```
    This will generate a JSON file containing the classified actions based on the detected poses.
